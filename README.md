Hiya there! This is the public repo of my personal website arvindg.com which is hosted on the github pages, You can view, share and build upon it for your own website if you want to.   

The site is mainly the hero page for now, but I'll keep updating if and any requirement comes up.

Its written in Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

Resources I've used:
